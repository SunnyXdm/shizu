#### **1. App Initialization**
**When the user first opens the app:**
1. **Check Token:**
   - Retrieve the token from local storage (e.g., MMKV).
   - If a token exists:
     - Verify the token with the server via an HTTP request.
     - If valid, proceed to the **Home Page**.
     - If invalid, clear the token and redirect to the **Login Page**.
   - If no token exists, redirect to the **Login Page**.

2. **Login Process:**
   - Display the **Login Page**.
   - After successful login:
     - Save the token to local storage.
     - Redirect the user to the **Home Page**.

---

#### **2. Home Page Workflow**
**When the user navigates to the Home Page:**

   ##### **A. Chat List Handling**
   1. **First-Time Loading:**
      - Show a loading indicator while fetching the chat list.
      - Fetch the user's chat list from the server via an HTTP request.
      - Cache the chat list locally using MMKV for offline access.
      - Display the chat list in a `FlatList`.

   2. **Subsequent Visits:**
      - Immediately fetch the chat list from MMKV for instant UI rendering.
      - Simultaneously fetch the updated chat list from the server in the background.
      - Merge any updates into the locally cached chat list and refresh the UI.

   ##### **B. Chat Messages Handling**
   **When the user clicks on a chat:**
   1. **First-Time Opening a Chat:**
      - Show a loading indicator while fetching messages.
      - Fetch the last set of chat messages from the server.
      - Save the messages to MMKV for offline access.
      - Display the chat messages in a scrolling UI (`FlatList` or `ScrollView`).

   2. **Subsequent Openings:**
      - Fetch cached messages from MMKV for immediate display.
      - Fetch the latest messages from the server in the background.
      - Merge new messages with cached ones and update the UI.

   ---

   ##### **C. Sending Messages**
   1. **User Sends a Message:**
      - Optimistically add the message to the UI for instant feedback.
      - Save the message locally using MMKV.
      - Send the message to the server via an HTTP request or WebSocket.
      - If the server confirms delivery:
      - Update the local message status (e.g., "delivered").
      - If the server fails to confirm delivery:
      - Retry sending or notify the user of failure.

   2. **Server-Side Handling:**
      - If the recipient is online:
      - Deliver the message via WebSocket.
      - If the recipient is offline:
      - Queue the message for later delivery via push notifications.

   ---

#### **3. Real-Time Communication**
**Establish WebSocket Connection:**
1. Connect to the server when the user logs in or the Home Page loads.
2. Authenticate the WebSocket connection using the user's token.
3. Handle incoming events:
   - **New Messages:** Add to the appropriate chat in real time.
   - **Typing Indicators:** Update the UI to show when the other user is typing.
   - **Message Status Updates:** Update the message status (e.g., "read").

4. Handle disconnection:
   - Implement automatic reconnection with exponential backoff.
   - Notify the user if the connection fails after multiple attempts.

---

#### **4. Notifications**
1. **Push Notifications:**
   - Use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for delivering notifications when the app is in the background.
   - Include metadata in the notification payload (e.g., chat ID, sender name).

2. **Handling Notifications:**
   - When the user taps a notification:
     - Navigate them directly to the relevant chat.
     - Fetch any new messages for that chat.

---

#### **5. Data Management and Caching**
1. **MMKV for Caching:**
   - Store frequently accessed data like:
     - User token.
     - Chat list.
     - Recent messages.
   - Use keys structured by chat ID for efficient retrieval (e.g., `messages_<chatId>`).

2. **Data Synchronization:**
   - Use background sync to periodically update the chat list and messages.
   - Handle data conflicts gracefully by prioritizing server-side updates.

---

#### **6. Offline Support**
1. **Offline Access:**
   - Allow users to view cached chat lists and messages even without an internet connection.
   - Queue unsent messages locally and send them when the connection is restored.

2. **Network Status Monitoring:**
   - Display a "No Internet" banner if the connection is lost.
   - Resume syncing automatically when the connection is re-established.

---

#### **7. Security Best Practices**
1. **Authentication:**
   - Use short-lived tokens with refresh tokens to enhance security.
2. **Data Encryption:**
   - Encrypt all communication (e.g., HTTPS for HTTP requests, WSS for WebSocket).
   - Encrypt sensitive data stored locally (e.g., chat messages).
3. **Token Validation:**
   - Validate tokens on the server to prevent unauthorized access.

---

#### **8. UI/UX Enhancements**
1. **Loading States:**
   - Use skeleton loaders for chat lists and messages.
2. **Typing Indicators:**
   - Show real-time typing indicators for active chats.
3. **Read Receipts:**
   - Display "delivered" and "read" statuses for sent messages.

---

#### **9. Advanced Features (Optional)**
1. **Message Reactions:**
   - Allow users to react to messages (e.g., thumbs up, heart).
2. **Media Sharing:**
   - Enable sharing of images, videos, and files.
3. **Search Functionality:**
   - Add a search bar to find chats or messages quickly.
4. **Theming:**
   - Allow users to customize the app's appearance with themes.
